Using NFHS-4 data to understand survey analysis on R

The National Family Health survey data set is conducted by the Demographic and Health Surveys and Indian Institue of Population Sciences.

This repository demonstrates the use of the Survey package in R by analysing the children data set of NFHS-4 (2015-16). 

I have also used tmap package of R and spatial data from the database of global administrative areas to show a heatmap of stunting by state.
